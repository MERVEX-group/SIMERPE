The Secretariat is directly involved in coordinating some of these activities, although much of the practical work is carried out by the Contracting Parties. The Secretariat maintains a large number of databases containing information on fishery statistics useful for stock assessment, as well as compliance-related records. The activities on research and statistics, under the direct supervision of the Assistant Executive Secretary and Scientific Coordinator, are conducted by the Department of Research and Statistic. This Department is staffed by eleven people: a Head of Department and Fisheries Data Analyst, a Population Dynamics Expert, a By-catch Coordinator, a Biostatistician, a Database Programmer, a Database Programmer and Webmaster, a Programming Technician, a Database Programmer and GIS expert, and three Software Developers.
