 <h5><b>Manuela Azevedo</b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">Manuela Azevedo is a senior scientist at the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA). She graduated in marine biology in 1982 and has a MSc in statistics and probabilities. She develops and applies quantitative methods for fish and fisheries dynamics and for fisheries advice and management. She started her career with the stock assessment of bigeye tuna (ICCAT) and with studies to support the development of the Portuguese swordfish long-line fishery. She has been engaged with ICES for almost 30 years in several capacities: as an active member and chair of several ICES expert working groups and workshops, as member of the Advisory Committee, as Vice-Chair of the Advisory Committee and as Portuguese member of ICES Council. She was invited Professor at the University of O´Porto for a decade, teaching statistics.  </p>

 <h5><b>Marta Coll </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">Her research focuses on understanding patterns and processes that characterise marine ecosystems and, in particular, changes of, and threats to, marine biodiversity. She studies population, community and food-web dynamics linked with human activities (such as fisheries, climate change, eutrophication, and invasive species), and how these translate into changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and services that humans obtain from the ocean. She develops and applies a variety of ecological analyses such as ecosystem modelling techniques and statistical tools, and she uses historical data, fisheries statistics, experimental results and field data sets. </p>

 <h5><b>Alfonso Pérez Rodríguez </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">Alfonso Pérez Rodríguez has a degree in biology, and a doctorate in fishing ecology. His lines of research are related to the biological and ecological processes that determine the productivity of fishing resources, such as growth, maturation, reproductive potential and natural mortality from predation. In addition, he works on stock assessment and design and evaluation of management strategies, where he tries to apply the results of his research. He currently works at the Bergen Institute for Marine Research. </p>

 <h5><b>Dorleta García </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"> Dorleta García, PhD in mathematics and statistics, has more than 15 years of experience in fisheries modelling and management. Her work is focused on stock assessment, bio-economic modelling of fisheries systems and statistical data analysis. She has a long experience in bioeconomic modelling of fisheries systems and management strategy evaluation (MSE) and has led the development of the bio-economic mixed fisheries model FLBEIA.  Currently, she is the international coordinator of the Northern stock of European Hake and Mixed Fisheries advice in Bay of Biscay in ICES.  In the last years she has been involved in the evaluation of management strategies for data-limited stocks in the framework of multi-stock and multi-fleet fishery systems, with special interest on the uncertainty conditioning and sensitivity analysis of the models used.

 <h5><b>Manuel Hidalgo </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"> Dr. Manuel Hidalgo is a fisheries ecologist and oceanographer working as senior scientist for the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) at the Oceanographic Center of the Balearic Islands (Palma, Spain). His research focuses on the impact of fishing activity and climate variability on the ecological mechanisms that regulate exploited populations, communities and ecosystems. He particularly works on the hydroclimatic influence on the spatial ecology of early life stages of exploited species, including survival and connectivity processes, synergistic effects of climate and fisheries on vital traits and spatial and temporal dynamics of exploited species, and indicators of resistance and resilience of impacted marine ecosystems. Manuel is member of several ICES working groups (WG), has chaired an integrated ecosystem assessment WG for six years and is currently alternate member of SCICOM.
