<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><b>Abstract</b> -
Nowadays the single-stock assessment approach is the most used one for the management of marine resources. However, the consequences of fishing on the dynamics of exploited stocks are not necessarily the only ones. Environmental and ecosystem dynamics, and economic and social aspects are also highly relevant, and can interact with fishing impacts. However, these factors are often overlooked when making management decisions.
 In particular, small pelagic fish species (SPF), such as European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), are some of the most commercial species the NW Mediterranean Sea. They have shown important changes in the last decade as shifts in abundance, biomass, body condition, growth, reproduction and spatial distribution. Different hypotheses have been formed to explain these changes: such as an increase in fishing impacts; changes in environmental conditions that have affected annual recruitment, growth, general conditions of organisms, and planktonic productivity and quality; the recent recovery of pelagic predators; and competition for food with jellyfish or round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) that has been increasing in abundance in the area. 
During three consecutive projects, SPELMED, PELWEB and PELCAT, we aimed at generating new knowledge and integrating the available one into a multi-modelling platform to quantify the impacts and project future trajectories of change. Specifically, we aimed at (1) quantifying the ecological and socio-economic consequences of changes in SPF population distributions on iconic predator species, their fisheries and ecosystem dynamics, and (2) identifying robust future management options to achieve resilient SPF populations in order to ensure healthy populations of small pelagic fish and sustainable exploitation under climate change. During this talk I will showcase the tools that we used to generate and integrate results, going from stock assessments to species distribution models and process-oriented ecosystem spatial-temporal models. I will present main results of our endeavour and I will illustrate the importance to consider environmental, ecological and socio-economic factors when managing exploited resources from an ecosystem-based management perspective considering the effects of climate change.
