<li><p align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - The evaluation process in the Scientific Councils of Regional Fisheries Organisations 
</br>
<b>Speakers - Dr. Ricardo Alpoim, </b>
</br>
The needs to incorporate various international agreements (e.g. Rio Summit, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, Johannesburg Summit) have determined how to incorporate aspects such as Maximum Sustainable Yield or the Precautionary Approach in the assessment process. In addition, other elements, such as the collection and storage of information, the models used, the quality control of the assessment process or the way in which scientific advice is provided to managers, have been developed differently in each organisation. In this session we will have relevant scientists from organisations such as NAFO, GFCM, ICCAT or ICES, whose will present how they have solved these considerations.   </p></li>

<li><p align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - The future of stock assessment
</br>
<b>Speakers - </b>
</br>
 Nowadays, the assessment of single-stocks is the main scientific basis for the management of fishery resources. Since Beverton and Holt settled the scientific foundations for management in the 1950s, the assessment process has continuously evolved, supported by the development of computers and scientific knowledge. Recently, several lines of work are being developed in new topics such as Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), integrated models, state-space models, spatial considerations, models for mixed fisheries, Bayesian models, etc. In this session we will have leading researchers in these lines of assessment to enlighten us on what we can expect from these developments.</p></li>
 
 <li><p align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - The extension of the assessment to ecological, social and economic considerations
</br>
<b>Speakers - Dr. Alfonso Pérez Rodríguez, </b>
</br>
 The scientific basis for advice based on the assessment of individual stocks is the most developed and the basis for current management. However, the consequences of fishing activity on the biomass of these stocks are not necessarily the most relevant impact for deciding on management measures. Ecosystem, economic and social impacts are equally or more relevant. However, these considerations are often overlooked when making management decisions. Why is this due to? Is this due to a lack of methodological development? or maybe due to a lack of relevant data for these analyses? To answer these questions we will have leading researchers in these fields who will try to lay on the table the keys to this limitation and its possible solutions.
</p></li>
 
 <li><p align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - Collaboration between administrations, industry and scientists in improving the assessment process.
</br>
<b>Speakers - </b>
</br>
 We often refer to the necessary collaboration between administrations, the fishing sector and scientists for efficient resource management. This simile makes use of a relatively small technological device capable of moving a large ship to illustrate a relationship between three sectors that, if well ordered, must be key for the sustainability of resources. Perhaps this much-needed relationship is not yet on a par with the perfection of the propeller. There are still barriers and mistrust to overcome. There are points of convergence but also points of disagreement. However, these three sectors do agree that effective collaboration is necessary. This discussion table is intended to explore in greater depth how to advance and improve this collaboration. To this end, we will have participants from the administration, the fishing sector and science.</p></li>
