<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><b>Abstract</b>
Nowadays the single-stock assessment approach is the most used one for the management of marine resources. However, the consequences of fishing on the dynamics of exploited stocks are not necessarily the only ones. Environmental and ecosystem dynamics, and economic and social aspects are also highly relevant, and can interact with fishing impacts. However, these factors are often overlooked when making management decisions.
 In particular, small pelagic fish species (SPF), such as European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), are some of the most commercial species the NW Mediterranean Sea. They have shown important changes in the last decade as shifts in abundance, biomass, body condition, growth, reproduction and spatial distribution. Different hypotheses have been formed to explain these changes: such as an increase in fishing impacts; changes in environmental conditions that have affected annual recruitment, growth, general conditions of organisms, and planktonic productivity and quality; the recent recovery of pelagic predators; and competition for food with jellyfish or round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) that has been increasing in abundance in the area. 
During three consecutive projects, SPELMED, PELWEB and PELCAT, we aimed at generating new knowledge and integrating the available one into a multi-modelling platform to quantify the impacts and project future trajectories of change. Specifically, we aimed at (1) quantifying the ecological and socio-economic consequences of changes in SPF population distributions on iconic predator species, their fisheries and ecosystem dynamics, and (2) identifying robust future management options to achieve resilient SPF populations in order to ensure healthy populations of small pelagic fish and sustainable exploitation under climate change. During this talk I will showcase the tools that we used to generate and integrate results, going from stock assessments to species distribution models and process-oriented ecosystem spatial-temporal models. I will present main results of our endeavour and I will illustrate the importance to consider environmental, ecological and socio-economic factors when managing exploited resources from an ecosystem-based management perspective considering the effects of climate change.

</br>
<b>Speakers -</b> Dr. Ricardo Alpoim, ...
</br>
The needs to incorporate various international agreements (e.g. Rio Summit, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, Johannesburg Summit) have determined how to incorporate aspects such as Maximum Sustainable Yield or the Precautionary Approach in the assessment process. In addition, other elements, such as the collection and storage of information, the models used, the quality control of the assessment process or the way in which scientific advice is provided to managers, have been developed differently in each organisation. In this session we will have relevant scientists from organisations such as NAFO, GFCM, ICCAT or ICES, whose will present how they have solved these considerations.   </p></li>

<li><p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - The future of stock assessment
</br>
<b>Speakers -</b> coming soon 
</br>
 Nowadays, the assessment of single-stocks is the main scientific basis for the management of fishery resources. Since Beverton and Holt settled the scientific foundations for management in the 1950s, the assessment process has continuously evolved, supported by the development of computers and scientific knowledge. Recently, several lines of work are being developed in new topics such as Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), integrated models, state-space models, spatial considerations, models for mixed fisheries, Bayesian models, etc. In this session we will have leading researchers in these lines of assessment to enlighten us on what we can expect from these developments.</p></li>
 
 <li><p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - The extension of the assessment to ecological, social and economic considerations
</br>
<b>Speakers - </b> Dr. Alfonso Pérez Rodríguez, ...
</br>
 The scientific basis for advice based on the assessment of individual stocks is the most developed and the basis for current management. However, the consequences of fishing activity on the biomass of these stocks are not necessarily the most relevant impact for deciding on management measures. Ecosystem, economic and social impacts are equally or more relevant. However, these considerations are often overlooked when making management decisions. Why is this due to? Is this due to a lack of methodological development? or maybe due to a lack of relevant data for these analyses? To answer these questions we will have leading researchers in these fields who will try to lay on the table the keys to this limitation and its possible solutions.

 <li><p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"> <b>Title</b> - Collaboration between administrations, industry and scientists in improving the assessment process.
</br>
<b>Speakers -</b> coming soon 
</br>
 We often refer to the necessary collaboration between administrations, the fishing sector and scientists for efficient resource management. This simile makes use of a relatively small technological device capable of moving a large ship to illustrate a relationship between three sectors that, if well ordered, must be key for the sustainability of resources. Perhaps this much-needed relationship is not yet on a par with the perfection of the propeller. There are still barriers and mistrust to overcome. There are points of convergence but also points of disagreement. However, these three sectors do agree that effective collaboration is necessary. This discussion table is intended to explore in greater depth how to advance and improve this collaboration. To this end, we will have participants from the administration, the fishing sector and science.</p></li>
